The three protein options are: chicken shwarma, beef shwarma, of falafel, and you choose from making a pita sandwich, couscous bowl, rice bowl, salad, or a hummus bowl. A lil tip - you get a LOT more from a bowl vs a pita sandwich, and bowls come WITH a pita. The price difference is only a dollar more for the bowl, so I would recommend you opt for that option if you are super hungry!",5.0 star rating,1,1,0

It looked like and awesome happy hour or lunch spot. Today we had visitors in town and took them here. We came a little after peak lunch time with a group of six and easily got a table. The food was average. The waitress was less than friendly but our food came out fairly quickly which is always important at lunch time. When it came time to get the check I asked if we could be split up which almost every lunch place does. I was told NO but we could put in 6 cards. Not ideal at all but I get it. When we got back our receipts to sign the original receipt was missing. The overall average seemed high then one girl caught that her whole receipt was a tip. This wasn't on anyone else receipt. I am 99% sure our waitress added a tip to herself and didn't mention anything. This seems very misleading. She ended up getting a 20% tip from everyone and her bonus tip. Honestly if she had been friendly I could really care less and wouldn't of written this but she was not. I would not recommend coming here and think they are a little shady. Bad staff will kill a restaurant and that is clearly and issue here.,2.0 star rating,14,0,0

It actually felt like we were a bother. We received our order of a Chicago Style dog and a Maxwell Street Polish in a timely manner; however, it was long enough for me to look around. There was a cobweb hanging from one of the lights to the wall over where people were sitting, and the floor was disgusting. The door leading to the kitchen was propped open and I could see a young lady chopping onions back there with no gloves. Once our order was ready, I noticed that the bottom half of my hot dog bun was hard, and I picked it up and knocked it on the table. The bun was so hard that it didn't even fling crumbs around. I looked over at the two people ""working"" and they were just hanging out, but I decided that neither one would care enough about my hard-as-a rock hot bun, so I just ate the top half.
